Given an array points where points[i] = [xi, yi] represents a point on the X-Y plane, return true if these points are a boomerang.

A boomerang is a set of three points that are all distinct and not in a straight line.

 

Example 1:

Input: points = [[1,1],[2,3],[3,2]]
Output: true
Example 2:

Input: points = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]]
Output: false
 

Constraints:

points.length == 3
points[i].length == 2
0 <= xi, yi <= 100

formula : 
(x1-x3)*(y2-y3)-(x2-x3)*(y1-y3)=0 

if equal to 0 - the points lie on the same straight line
