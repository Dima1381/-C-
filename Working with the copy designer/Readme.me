Task:
Create a class whose constructor generates a dynamic array of numbers (data type - integer).
The size of the array is specified by the constructor parameter.
The destructor frees the memory allocated for the array.
Create a function whose parameter is the created class.
The function performs actions on the array:
 - expression for calculating the element of the array: for even = i-5, odd = i;
 - Find the number of even elements;
Implement the copy constructor.
