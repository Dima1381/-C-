Write a game that simulates the throwing of dice by the computer and the user.
There are 2 dice in the game, and each of them can yield from 1 to 6 points.
Implement the program's definition of the first person to walk.
Everyone makes four throws.
After the rolls, show the dice painted with symbols and the number of points that fell on them.
After a pair of throws (the computer's throw + the user's throw), display the intermediate result on the screen - the number of points scored by the player and the computer.
At the end, announce who won based on the results of all the throws.
Implement the game using functions.
